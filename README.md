# Virtual Assistant with Basic Features

Welcome to my Virtual Assistant repository! This project is a basic virtual assistant designed using Python, aimed at providing simple functionalities to assist users with tasks using voice commands.

## Features:

- **Speech Recognition:** Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to understand and process voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Employs the `pyttsx3` library to convert text into speech for providing responses and feedback.
- **Date and Time:** Provides current date and time functionalities using the `datetime` library.
- **Wikipedia Integration:** Allows users to search for information on Wikipedia using the `wikipedia` library.
- **Web Browsing:** Enables the virtual assistant to open web browsers using `webbrowser`.
- **Operating System Interaction:** Performs basic operating system interactions such as opening files or directories using the `os` library.
- **Randomization:** Implements randomization features using the `random` library.
- **GUI Automation:** Utilizes `pyautogui` for automating GUI interactions.
